# 💧 Water Quality Prediction - RMS

This project aims to predict multiple water quality parameters using machine learning techniques, specifically a `MultiOutputRegressor` wrapped around a `RandomForestRegressor`. It was developed as part of a **1-month AICTE Virtual Internship sponsored by Shell** in **June 2025**.

---

## 🌍 Overview

Access to clean water is a critical global concern. Accurate prediction of various water quality metrics can help in the early detection of pollution and ensure timely intervention.

In this project, we:

- Collected and preprocessed real-world water quality datasets
- Used supervised machine learning for multi-target regression
- Built a pipeline using `MultiOutputRegressor` with `RandomForestRegressor`
- Evaluated the model using appropriate regression metrics

## 🧪 Technologies Used

- **Python 3.12**
- **Pandas, NumPy** – Data handling and preprocessing
- **Scikit-learn** – Machine learning model building and evaluation
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** – Data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Interactive development environment

---

## 📈 Predicted Water Quality Parameters

The model predicts the following water quality indicators:

- **NH₄ (Ammonium)**
- **BOD5 (Biochemical Oxygen Demand - 5 days)**
- **Colloids**
- **O₂ (Dissolved Oxygen)**
- **NO₃ (Nitrate)**
- **NO₂ (Nitrite)**
- **SO₄ (Sulfate)**
- **PO₄ (Phosphate)**
- **CL (Chloride)**

---

## 📊 Model Performance

The model was evaluated using:

- **R² Score**
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**

Performance was acceptable across all target parameters, demonstrating the model's ability to predict multiple outputs reliably.
